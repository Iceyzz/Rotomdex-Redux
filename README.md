The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for core features such as command handling.

No data besides what is defined below will be used, and no data is shared with any third party sites or services.

- Server ID and corresponding metadata (e.g. server size, server creation date)
- User ID and corresponding metadata (e.g. username, account creation date)

Data may be updated as the user requests through various commands/actions.

The bot may keep the stored information using an internal caching mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added as required.
Data may be dropped from cache prematurely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

Stored data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. 
This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. 
Re-inviting the bot will restore the default values back to the bot's database.
